# Project 3 Proposal
Topic: Customer Wine choice by preferences in the U.S 
Introduction:
The goal of this data analysis project is to develop a model that can display wines based on customer preferences in the United States. By leveraging a comprehensive wine dataset, we aim to gain insights into the factors that influence wine preferences that assist customers in making informed wine choices.
Dataset and Preprocessing:
We will utilize a wine dataset specifically curated for the US market, comprising 50,504 records. The dataset will include essential features such as Â¬grape variety, region, vintage, customer ratings, and other relevant attributes. Before analysis, we will perform data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats to ensure data quality and consistency.
